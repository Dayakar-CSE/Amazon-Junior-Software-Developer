In the previous lab, you created dynamic web pages using JSP. To continue with QuickCart’s requirement of displaying the product catalog dynamically to its customers, this lab will use Thymeleaf, a more modern, powerful, and flexible Java templating engine. 

Unlike JSP, Thymeleaf integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, simplifying development with minimal configuration. Thymeleaf enables developers to work with templates that are closer to standard HTML, making them simpler to design and easier to maintain.

As you work through this lab, you’ll create dynamic product views using Thymeleaf, enhancing your application's presentation layer. This skill is essential as you progress towards becoming a full-stack developer, giving you hands-on experience with dynamic content rendering.

Goal

Create a dynamic product catalog page using Thymeleaf in a Spring MVC application.


By the end of this lab, you'll understand why Thymeleaf is preferred over JSP in modern Spring Boot projects, and you'll have hands-on experience creating dynamic views—an indispensable skill for any aspiring software developer.
