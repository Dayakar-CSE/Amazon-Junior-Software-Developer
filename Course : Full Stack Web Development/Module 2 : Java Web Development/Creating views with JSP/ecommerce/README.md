Activity: Creating views with JSP
You’ve been working on the QuickCart web application and setting up its structure using Spring MVC. Now, the store wants to showcase its product catalog dynamically to the customers. 

In this lab, you will create a page to list product items using Java Server Pages (JSP). You will build a Product model to represent individual products and a product controller to handle product data and route requests. Finally, you will create a JSP file that dynamically renders the list of products.

Goal

Create a dynamic product catalog page using JSP in a Spring MVC project.

By completing this lab, you'll gain experience working with Spring controllers, models, views, and JSP integration. These skills are crucial for developing interactive and dynamic web applications, laying the foundation for building more complex views in the future.
